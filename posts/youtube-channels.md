With the internet, we now live in an age where the cumulative knowledge of this world is online like literally just several clicks away. This has made it possible for people to learn new skills virtually through platforms such as **Youtube**. Without having to physically attend a class, with just your computer/phone and internet access you can look up literally anything on Youtube. 

In this article, I will share my top **Youtube channels** to learn Programming concepts. 

**NB: I know there are other great channels too with great content. This list is my personal opinion and purely based on the channels I have interacted with and the techs I have explored in my learning journey so far. **

This list is not in any order whatsoever.

When I was in school, this was the Youtube channel everyone used to learn Programming concepts especially Java since we were doing Java in school at that time. This channel has tutorials on most of programming concepts. The instructor is a great tutor. He breaks down the concepts really well explains them clearly making it easy to understand. His sense of humor is on another level. I used this channel to teach myself Python and Django in my final year in school and landed a Python internship right after school. If you are looking to have fun and laugh as you learn, check out this channel.

I came across this channel while starting out at JavaScript in 2020 as I was doing the FreeCodeCamp Web Development Certification challenge. The most amazing thing about this channel is that it has crash courses for almost every technology. The instructor explains the concepts really well. I still remember struggling with props drilling in my early React days and this channel came to my rescue after struggling to grasp the concept for several days. If you’re looking to get started on any tech, you should check out this channel. It also has great projects you can build through and level up your skills.

**3.  [MyCodeSchool](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool)**

First time I heard of this channel was when  [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia) shared an article about it on FreeCodeCamp’s website. It’s a really sad story but also super inspiring. You can check it out  [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mycodeschool-youtube-channel-history/) . I read the article and immediately jumped into Youtube and searched out this channel. This is a really great channel to learn Data Structures and Algorithms. Those guys really knew how to break down concepts and explain them in a super simple way through well illustrated examples.   

**4.  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ)**

I came across this channel in 2020 as I was doing the FreeCodeCamp’s Web Development Certification. It has a lot of tutorials on Web Development: HTML, CSS, JS, e.t.c The most incredible things is Florin Pop completed the entire FreeCodeCamp’s Web Certification in under a month while streaming the whole thing on Youtube. There are many other livestreams of projects in the channel that you can learn a lot from and push your coding skills to the next level.

I have learned a lot of React and Firebase concepts from this guy since his days at the Clever Programmer channel. He explains React really well. I remember struggling with Redux and wondering if I’ll ever grasp this then I came across two livestreams at this channel and with a couple of builds I started having those, “Aahh...now I see..” moments with Redux. If you’re looking to level up your React, Firebase, React Native, e.tc game, look up this channel.
