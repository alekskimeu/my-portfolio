I jumped on, created an account and even joined the  Frontend Mentor Slack channel in order to collaborate  with others who are probably solving the challenges. However, I kept on procrastinating this until today when I decided to finally jump in.

If you donn't already know,Frontend Mentor is a website that helps developers improve their front-end coding skills by building real projects. The website provides lot's of HTML, CSS and JavaScript challenges in the form of web designs. These challenges are divided into categories based on the users' skill/experience level.

Check it out: [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

To work on the challenges, you just need to pick the one you would love to work on from the list of the provided challenges, code out the design and submit
your solution. You can also give and ask for feedback from other users after submitting your solutions.

I picked a fairly simple challenge to start me off. This required me to use only HTML and CSS to complete it.

Source code: [Github repo](https://github.com/alekskimeu/frontendmentor-3-column-card)

I employed the following techniques to complete the challenge:

## 1. Flexbox

I used Flexbox to center the entire container vertically and horizontally on the browser window. I achieved this by giving the container a height of 100vh, setting justify-content and align-items properties to center and giving my cards container a height of 100%.

## 2. CSS Grid

I used CSS Grid with 3 grid columns to lay the cards next to each other horizontally. Flexbox would work but I have a personal preference for CSS Grid. On mobile devices, I only needed to change the number of grid columns to one to lay the cards one by one vertically.

## 3. Border radius

As shown in the provided designs, the first and the last card shave rounded borders on their 2 corners The Lear More buttons in each card are rounded too. I applied border radius on these elements to achieve this look.

##  4. Git/Github

Once I was done, I created a public repo on Github and pushed my code.


##  5. Deployment

I used Netlify to deploy my solution. There are other free hosting sites one could use such as Github pages and Vercel.

This was a fairly simple challenge. I needed it to kick start my journey in solving Frontend Mentor challenges. I look forward to working on more challenges, collaborating with others and learning along the way.

*Coding, just like everything in life, the more you do it, the better you become at it.*
