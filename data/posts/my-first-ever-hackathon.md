title: 'My First Ever Hackathon'
excerpt: 'A couple days ago I posted a photo of me and my friends presenting a prototype in a Hackathon almost 5 years ago and they both commented reminiscing the whole experience we had back then, so I thought I could write something about the event.'

A <b>Hackathon</b> is an event where people come together and collaboratively work to solve problems. 

As defined in [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/hackathon#:~:text=A%20hackathon%2C%20also%20known%20as,an%20event%20marked%20by%20endurance.), a hackathon is a social coding event that brings computer programmers and other interested people together to improve upon or build a new software program.

The time is September 2017. I was a 3rd year in <b>Maseno University</b> majoring in <b>IT</b>. At that time, the <b>Health IT project</b> from <b>University of Nairobi</b> in collaboration with our University had organized a 3 day Hackathon with cool prizes for the top 3 teams.

The goal of the Hackathon was to introduce the participants to Health Systems used in Kenya, specifically the [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/), and to have the participants work on prototypes to try and address some of the shortcomings of the system.

When we heard about this for the first time, my friends and I brushed it off. We were not interested in this for a number of reasons:

1. We didn't consider ourselves programmers. It's worth noting that at that time, we didn't have much focus on programming. We were more focussed on computer networking and <b>CISCO</b> technology. Therefore, we felt we didn't have what it takes to participate in a programming Hackathon.

2. We were afraid of embarrassing ourselves in front of 2nd years who were also participating in the Hackathon and who considered us as more informed, more knowledgeable seniors.

3. We didn't know much about Health Systems. How they work, store and process data.

I know these reasons are kind of dumb but that's how we felt back then. We spent a couple of days debating about this whether to go or not. Eventually, we made up our minds and decided we had nothing to lose by participating and that it would be an awesome learning opportunity for us and we registered for the Hackathon.

The first day of the Hackathon I was really nervous but I tried to remain calm and collected. The venue was one of the computer labs at the university. 

The Health IT team introduced us to the Health System and the problems we will be trying to address for the next 3 or so days.

We worked at the computer lab for the 3 days with a couple of tea breaks and lunch break everyday. The food was awesome. We had smokies, sweet potatoes, yams, bread and mandazis with tea for the tea breaks and chicken, rice, chapatis and beef for lunch.

We were asked to divide ourselves into groups of 3 or 4 and this is where I ended up in a team with [Steve](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/stephenodhiamboodipo) and <b>Christine</b>. Steve was my classmate, majoring in <b>IT</b> as well and my friend from day one in the university. He was the first person I met on the admission day. He was great in Public speaking and presentation skills. He could clearly explain problems and the solutions to solve them.

[Christine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-njoroge-70385211a/) was majoring in <b>Computer Technology</b> and had a unique passion for coding. She was more knowledgeable in coding and it felt nice having her in our team. She understood systems, APIs and Databases. We could depend on her for the Hackathon-:) She was already friends with Steve. I had seen her around but never really got to meet her until that day.

We introduced ourselves to each other in the team, gave our team a cool codename <b>'TechMedics'</b>, settled down in our table and analyzed the problems on the board. We ended up picking a problem that addressed Kisumu county Health sector and could be solved by developing a custom Health Dashboard for the county to allow for easier access of health data within the county and make it easy for the county health sector to make informed decisions. Sounds easy? Well, not at that time.

To be able to achieve this, we at least needed to study the [DHIS2 Web API](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-235/web-api.html) Web API documentation and understand it, create a user in the[DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/) test database and create a Dashboard with the data fetched from the system's test Database through the API. At that time, this was one hell of a task. It was my first time to hear the term API.

The documentation was super confusing at that time. I remember reading through it and at some point feeling 'Yeah, this can actually work', then at the next point, 'Oh crap! How the heck are we supposed to deal with all this?'

There was authentication to deal with, API calls to fetch the data from the Database and visual representation of the data on the custom Dashboard. It was just too much at that time. I almost gave up after the first day. I remember thinking of not showing up the second day. 

However, I showed up and we kept pushing together as a team, thinking of different approaches and trying to come up with the best one to address the problem. Eventually, we managed to create a prototype (with a few bugs of course -:), after a lot of docs reading, a couple of sleepless nights and a little help from the Health IT project team.

The final day of the Hackathon was the most nervy one. We had to present our approach to addressing the problem we handled and showcase a working prototype before the other teams, our lecturers, the Health IT project team and a panel of judges.

One by one the teams made their presentations. Each presentation was followed by a bunch of questions from the other participants, our lecturers and the judges. Eventually, the nervy moment was all over. All the teams had presented and it was time for the judges to evaluate the presentations 
and announce the winners.

To cut the long story short, our team didn't make it to top 3. We were number 4. Number one, 2 and 3 received their prizes a couple weeks after the Hackathon. Our team got a follow up call to showcase our prototype at Kisumu County Health offices a week after the Hackathon. 

The whole Hackathon experience was awesome. This was the first Hackathon I ever attended. It was 3 days full of learning and growing. I learned a lot. How to approach technical problems and work with a team to address them. 
I got to meet Christine who would later introduce and coach us in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and <b>Git Version control</b> (Story for another day).

Had I missed this, I would have missed an incredible learning opportunity and a chance to meet awesome people. I'm glad I attended this.
